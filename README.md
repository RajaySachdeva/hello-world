<!-- From many years I want to own a restaurant,Thats give me the idea that why I don't design a website of a restaurant. In this course I want to do Html and CSS of a restaurant website where Admin can have the opportunity to change the content like adding photos of cusines, change rates, add new categories etc to show items available in the restaurant and.

I am planning to write html and css for the login page and home page for the restaurant with images.I will be adding header and footer to the home page that can be used by the website developer while developing Admin panel for the owner of the restaurant. Same header and footers can be used to give consistant look to all the pages that will be developed by the developer.

I would also like that this HTML and CSS support all kind of devices like desktops, tablets,mobiles with small and big screen so that it could accessible to a large number of users. So I want to learn how to make websites responsive.

I also want your inputs on this idea
